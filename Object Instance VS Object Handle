# Object Instance VS Object Handle

> [!NOTE]

The ObjectHandle class is used to pass an object (in a wrapped state)
between multiple application domains without loading the metadata for the wrapped object
in each AppDomain through which the ObjectHandle travels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
Thus, the ObjectHandle class gives the caller control of when the Type of the remote object is loaded into a domain
